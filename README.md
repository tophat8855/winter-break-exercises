# Winter Break Exercises

These were exercises assigned for gSchool SF winter break.

## Temperature Convertor

Create a simple temperature convertor.

## Odd Numbers

#### Does not have a spec file

Write code to print all the odd numbers between 1 and 1337

## Guessing Game

Create a program that picks a random number between 1 and 100 and then asks the user to guess the number. Once the user guesses a number, the program should say, higher, lower, or tell the user that they got the number correct. The user should continue to make guesses until he guesses correctly. Also, once the user guesses correctly, the program should print the number of guesses needed to arrive at the correct answer.

## Simple Ascii Art

#### Does not have a spec file

Using loops (don't just use a bunch of puts statements!), print out a simple ascii art triangle.

Ask the user for the number of rows and the ascii character that the pyramid should consist of.

## Reverse A String

Reverse a string in place. In other words, do not create a new string or use other methods on the string such as reverse. The goal of the problem is to use a loop and the string accessors to figure out which values to swap for other values.

## Palindrome Checker

Write code that determines if a given string is a palindrome. Do not use the .reverse() String method. You can use the code you wrote for the above problem.

## Prime Numbers

Write a method called prime_printer(max) which takes one integer argument. It should print out all the prime numbers between 0 and the given argument.

## Fibonacci

#### Does not have a spec file

Write code to print out the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.

## Multiplication Table

#### Does not have a spec file

Create a 9 x 9 multiplication table. Make sure to pay attention to spacing! Make it look nice! For an extra challenge, allow the user to specify the size of the multiplication table (3 x 10, 5 x 5, etc.)

## Screwing with the Array Class

Write the following methods ON the built in Array class: say_hello, count_evens
